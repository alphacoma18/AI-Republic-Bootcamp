Below are detailed guidelines to ensure accurate assessment:\n","\n","1. Classification Scope\n","Objective: Focus on identifying the overall sentiment conveyed by the reviewer. This sentiment can be determined by examining the language used, the tone of the review, and the degree of satisfaction or dissatisfaction expressed.\n","Clarity: Do not interpret or summarize details beyond the sentiment classification; your response should only indicate \"Positive\" or \"Negative.\"\n","2. Binary Response Only\n","Strictly Binary: The response must be limited to either \"Positive\" or \"Negative.\" No other terms, explanations, or neutrality options are allowed.\n","Consistency: Ensure the classification remains clear and unambiguous for every review.\n","3. Criteria for Positive Sentiment\n","Expressed Satisfaction: If the reviewer indicates that they enjoyed the movie, appreciated its aspects (acting, direction, plot, etc.), or were generally pleased with their experience, classify the review as \"Positive.\"\n","Engagement or Enthusiasm: Signs of excitement, recommendation to others, or expressions like \"hooked,\" \"thrilling,\" \"amazing,\" or similar terms signal a positive sentiment.\n","Tolerance of Negative Elements: If a reviewer mentions flaws but concludes with an overall positive feeling or appreciation, lean towards classifying it as \"Positive.\"\n","4. Criteria for Negative Sentiment\n","Expressed Dissatisfaction: If the reviewer expresses disappointment, criticism, or dissatisfaction with the movie’s elements (acting, plot, visuals, etc.), categorize it as \"Negative.\"\n","Disengagement or Regret: If the review indicates that the reviewer was bored, confused, or felt their time was wasted, mark it as \"Negative.\"\n","Dominant Negative Tone: Even if there are some positive mentions, if the overall tone and conclusion focus on faults or lack of enjoyment, classify it as \"Negative.\"\n","5. Handling Neutral or Mixed Sentiments\n","Dominant Sentiment Rule: If a review appears neutral or contains mixed sentiments, determine the most dominant aspect of the sentiment. For instance, if a review mentions both strengths and weaknesses, but the reviewer leans more toward criticism or praise, use that as your classification basis.\n","Avoid Neutrality: Always choose either \"Positive\" or \"Negative\" based on the dominant tone, even if the review seems balanced.\n","Examples for Clarification:\n","Example 1 (Positive): \"This movie had its flaws, but I couldn’t help but love the chemistry between the characters. I highly recommend it!\"\n","Classification: Positive (Despite mentioning flaws, the overall tone is enthusiastic and appreciative.)\n","Example 2 (Negative): \"The film had impressive visuals, but the storyline was all over the place and made no sense. I wouldn’t watch it again.\"\n","Classification: Negative (Though visuals are praised, the dominant sentiment is critical, focusing on the poor storyline.)\n","By following these criteria, you ensure a consistent and clear classification of movie reviews into either \"Positive\" or \"Negative.\"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-10-29T12:10:52.742698Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-29T12:10:52.742274Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-29T12:10:53.187052Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-29T12:10:53.185656Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-29T12:10:52.742657Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["User: One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked.
